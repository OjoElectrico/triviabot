Requires Python 2.7.\r\n\r\nSetting up\r\n=========\r\nOn *nix based operating systems (assuming you have Python 2.7 (and git, if not, shame on you)):\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Snowstormer/triviabot.git\r\n$ cd triviabot/\r\n$ cp config.example.json config.json\r\n$ python bot.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, you'd have to edit the config first to make it actually work, the example config is similar to this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"--NEED HELP?--\": \"--If you are unsure how to edit this config file, please visit the GitHub page for help.--\",\r\n\t\"server\": \"irc.myserver.com\",\r\n\t\"port\": 6667,\r\n\t\"nickname\": \"Triviabot\",\r\n\t\"password\": \"\",\r\n\t\"account\": \"\",\r\n\t\"channel\": \"#Trivia\",\r\n\t\"admins\": [\"admin\"],\r\n\t\"prefix\": \"!\",\r\n\r\n\t\"--OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION--\": \"--You don't have to edit anything below here, but you can if you so wish.--\",\r\n\t\"enabledtopics\": [\"topic\", \"topic\", \"topic\"],\r\n\t\"savepoints\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything is pretty self-explanatory - if your bot has no NickServ password, leave `password` blank. Leaving `account` blank will default it to the bot's nickname.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to disable any of the topics, just remove them from the `enabledtopics` array and you're good to go.\r\n\r\nSetting `savepoints` to true will make the bot keep all earned points even after the game is stopped or the bot disconnects through a points file (`points.json`), deleting this file will reset the points.\r\n\r\nCustom topics\r\n=============\r\nAdding custom topics is not hard, just create a new file in the `topics` directory called `(topic).json` - for example, `example.json`.\r\n\r\nThis is the basic structure of a topic file:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"Question\": [\"answer\"],\r\n\t\"Question 2\": [\"answer 2\", \"rewsna\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for question, you can put anything - however answers have some guidelines. To make answers not throw an error, you **have to** place them inside a array, yes, even if there's only one answer it has to be in a array.\r\n\r\nAnswers in the topic files that come with the bot are (mostly) all lowercase - this used to be a requirement, but is not anymore.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have to add your topic into the `config.json`. Just plop it into the `enabledtopics` array at any place - the array is sorted when displayed anyway.\r\n\r\nIf you think your topic is good enough to be in the core, you can submit a pull request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
